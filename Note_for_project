1}  3 object to go

    1) fault classification for CMAPSS system
        there are 5 types of fault
            Fan
            HPC
            LPC
            HPT
            LPT
            NON-fault

    2) RUL prediction remain useful life (units : times of flight)

    3) health idicator prediction
       health indicator varies from 1 to 0

# test set :
train_set = [0,2,4,6,8,10,11,12,13,15,16,17,18,20,21,22,23,25,26,27,28,30,31,32,33]

2}  steps:

    0), prepare  life cycle data  //  prepare   fuel flow an engine efficiency data
    for each flight , we have health indicator and RUL and fault classification,
    so 300 is the max times of RUL I'd like to use as mask to make all data have the same length
    totaly we have 6875 flight for 10 types classification. I want to chose 1000 randomly as test set

    1), normalization data
    this step is to minimiza flight data, for now, each flight contains about 7000 points data, which is obviously
    too large. maybe 100 - 200 is OK for each flight. and then, make the dataset at same length.

    PS : original data for each flight has title, nomalized data doesn't have title ( to simplify read date process)
    PS : same for the normed engine fuel flow and efficiency, we don't have label in engine_fuel_normed file
    PS : but for each label we do have title

    2), prepare dataset
    for data here, we prepare sequence data batch.
    *** important part:

        - each batch :

        in this part , for each case , I will look at 10 last flight to predict 3 indicator (health,RUL,fault_type)
        so for RNN each batch we have 10 flight * 100 (nearly) points for info per flight as sequence length
        and for RNN each sequence we have 32 points as censor info
        so for each batch, we have 10 * 100 = 10000 about sequence length and each sequence 32 point

      [  [[*,*,* ...... 32 ...*,*]
          [*,*,* ...... 32 ...*,*]
          ......
          1000
          ......
          *,*,* ...........32  ..]]

          ........
          5000 such sample as train set
          .............

        [[*,*,* ...... 32 ...*,*]
         [*,*,* ...... 32 ...*,*]
          ......
          1000
          ......
          *,*,* ...........32  ..]]  ]   

          so it's [5000,1000,32]
  

        - for num of batch :

        we have 35 set of data, we have about 250 flight (from 10 to 299 as set), so we get about 8000 batch

    3), train and test result process

        # It's different for all 3 types prediction label

        for fault type, it's a simple classification

        for RUL prediction it's a regression. empiracally, we can use direct RUL as label

        for HI , it's also a regression . but I'd like to predict HI*1000

        steps for train :

            data
             |
            LSTM -  NN -> result -> test ( graphe test for each 10 steps and testset statistical test for each step )

            so as result saved for train , we have:
                1 , model (not yet donr)
                2 , testset result
                3 , 35 graphe for 35 case to see predict precision


        * 1 - first model LSTM based 1 layer W * output_LSTM + b prediction

        basicly we want to use RNN(LSTM)
        
        so:

          ^      ^                 ^      ^   output : 32 items list
          |      |                 |      |
         [ ] -> [ ] -> .. 1000 -> [ ] -> [ ] <------ LSTM cell  
          ^      ^                 ^      ^   
          |      |                 |      |

          32     32                32     32

        randomly choose 5000 as training set
        randomly choose 1000 as test set
        batch size 100 sample 

        Input : 10 flight information

        for RUL and health indicator W * X + B 
        for fault type argmax(W * X + B)

        result for this model : 93% accuracy for classification
        for now : not work in RUL prediction

        Test result : I've not done transformation leraning, so obviously there is overfitting.
        classification : doable without transformated validation
        HI : non-doable
        RUL : non-doable


        * 2 - second model LSTM based 1 layer W * output_LSTM + b prediction

        basicly we want to use RNN(LSTM)

        so:

          ^      ^                 ^      ^   output : 32 items list
          |      |                 |      |
         [ ] -> [ ] -> .. 1000 -> [ ] -> [ ] <------ LSTM cell
          ^      ^                 ^      ^
          |      |                 |      |

          32     32                32     32

        randomly choose 5000 as training set
        randomly choose 1000 as test set
        batch size 100 sample

        and then we use a three layer neuro network 32|| -> 15||  ->  5->  RUL and HI

        Input : 10 flight information

        Test result : I've not done transformation leraning, so obviously there is overfitting.
        classification : doable without transfomated validation
        HI : non-doable
        RUL : non-doable


        * 3 - third model LSTM based 3 layer W * output_LSTM + b prediction

        basicly we want to use RNN(LSTM)  (all sequence )

        so:

          ^      ^                 ^      ^   output : 32 items list * 1000
          |      |                 |      |
         [ ] -> [ ] -> .. 1000 -> [ ] -> [ ] <------ LSTM cell
          ^      ^                 ^      ^
          |      |                 |      |

          32     32                32     32

        randomly choose 5000 as training set
        randomly choose 1000 as test set
        batch size 100 sample

        and then we use a three layer neuro network 32|| -> 15||  ->  5->  RUL and HI

        Input : 10 flight information

        Test result : I've not done transformation leraning, so obviously there is overfitting.
        classification : unknow (not yet test)
        HI : doable
        RUL : doable but not very good

        * 4 - fourthly model LSTM based 3 layer W * output_LSTM + b prediction

        basicly we want to use RNN(LSTM)  (all sequence )

        this time just a flight so 1000 as time sequence
        ( I've regenerated trainset and dataset . this time with transfomated validation and )

        so:

          ^      ^                 ^      ^   output : 32 items list * 1000
          |      |                 |      |
         [ ] -> [ ] -> .. 100 -> [ ] -> [ ] <------ LSTM cell
          ^      ^                 ^      ^
          |      |                 |      |

          32     32                32     32

        randomly choose 5000 as training set
        randomly choose 1000 as test set
        batch size 100 sample

        and then we use a three layer neuro network 32|| -> 15||  ->  5->  RUL and HI


        Input : just 1 flight information

        Test result :
        classification : non-doable
        HI : doable
        RUL : doable but not very good
        **************  important result*********** ( it justify that 1 flight is OK to predict HI with transformation learning )

        * 5 - 5th model version, try to use clustring methode to do fault classification
        not work --- forget it -_-

        * 6 - model LSTM based 3 layer W * output_LSTM + b prediction

        basicly we want to use RNN(LSTM)  (not all sequence for NN but the last 10 output as NN input)

        this time just a flight so 1000 as time sequence
        ( I've regenerated trainset and dataset . this time with transfomated validation and )

        so:

          ^      ^                 ^      ^   output : 61 items list * 10
          |      |                 |      |

          61     61                61     61

        randomly choose 5000 as training set
        randomly choose 1000 as test set
        batch size 100 sample

        and then we use a three layer neuro network 610|| -> 500||  ->250  ->  RUL and HI


        Input : just 1 flight information

        Test result :
        classification : non-doable
        HI : doable
        RUL : doable but not very good
        **************  important result*********** ( it justify that 1 flight is OK to predict HI and RUL )



3}  result

     1) log
        firstly a log to save train result

     2) visualization
        we want to give a good visualized result. so for the result we need to give some random example RUL and HI
        index for run to failure case

     3) quantification
        need to give some result in a example of
